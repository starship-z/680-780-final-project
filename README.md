WE HAD AN ISSUE WITH OUR ORIGINAL REPO SO WE HAD TO MOVE TO A NEW ONE

Project Proposal:
A mini game library to host single player minigames that you can play at any time.
For the scope of our project we believe that each member is responsible for one game separately,
and will work together on a third and the functionality of the app.

The app will be made in SwiftUI, consisting of navigation and 3 games hosted within the application.
